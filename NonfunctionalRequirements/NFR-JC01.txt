[SB-Sergejs Bolsedvorskis] This is a very good requirement and it should pass the quality gateway. There is a lack of services allowing disabled users to access and use their products. The website may increase the user base and may get a competitive advantage over its competitors by making reasonable adjustments to the usability and accessibility.
[JH] I found some great information which might help to support/implement this requirement - see https://www.visitbritain.org/providing-access-all
[PF-Paul Farmer] If this is a legal requirement, then is having an approval rating really a satisfactory fit criteria as it is too subjective? Shouldn't any legal requirement at least contain a fit criteria that indicates that the solution has been passed by the company legal department or even the legal entity itself as being fit for purpose.
[KF] I am not sure if the an approval rating is a good factor, would a better fit criterion surround access to a range of tools to make accessibility easier for disabled users.  For example, the ability to change text size, contrast colour and utilise a screen reader will be available on 95% of pages (or even 100%) if feeling confident.
