Comments:
[KF] not specified any particular file type to avoid limiting the solution in future
[SS] I agree with KF's comment above, but would also suggest that the requirement is technology specific in that it mentions the photographs must be 'uploaded',
which I feel partly describes the solution. While potentially it's probably safe to assume that photos will be uploaded, it is possible there may be a better
solution that we are unaware of.
