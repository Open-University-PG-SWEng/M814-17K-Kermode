Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[MM] What is an action in the Fit Criterion? Is it one complete form equals one action or is it 5 fields of data? If it's the latter, I don't think you'd get the full property details in. The prior could be a very large journey. I think if you could define what an action is and consider how much information is required for a property listing this would be a little more robust.
[SS] Took on board MM's comments and amended the fit criterion to be more specific
