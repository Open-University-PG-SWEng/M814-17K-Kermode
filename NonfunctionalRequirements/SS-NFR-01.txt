REQ-ID:SS-NFR-01
Description:The product shall make it easy for agents to add new properties to the system
Type:Usability (11)
Rationale:The ability to easily add properties to the system will help agents add properties quickly, and reduce barriers that may cause agents to not want to use the system
Fit Criterion:The addition of a new property to the system should take no longer than 5 minutes to complete for 90% of properties added to the system by new users of the system
Originator:Ayisha Jayakodi
Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[MM-Mike Moore] What is an action in the Fit Criterion? Is it one complete form equals one action or is it 5 fields of data? If it's the latter, I don't think you'd get the full property details in. The prior could be a very large journey. I think if you could define what an action is and consider how much information is required for a property listing this would be a little more robust.
[SS] Took on board MM's comments and amended the fit criterion to be more specific
[SW] I would suggest that the Fit Criterion does not match the Description well. The description is indeed suggesting a usability requirement, however the Fit Criterion reads to me more like a performance requirement. For example does the 5 minutes include time taken to upload 4K images on a sub 1mb internet connection? The system may be intuitive and easy to use, but also slow. As another example a "Wizard" that takes you through each step explicity may take more time to complete that a single form, but may be significantly easier to use
