[MM] What is an action in the Fit Criterion? Is it one complete form equals one action or is it 5 fields of data? If it's the latter, I don't think you'd get the full property details in. The prior could be a very large journey. I think if you could define what an action is and consider how much information is required for a property listing this would be a little more robust.
