REQ-ID: SS19-NFR
Description: The postal address repository should be able to contain a minimum of 16 characters.
Type: Usability and humanity requirements
Rationale: Some users postal addresses might be very long, so there should be enough room to fit them in but we do not want to give an open length.
Fit Criterion: The repository must be able to hold a string of maximum 16 characters.

Comments: [JH] Why is there a limit of 250 characters? It seems arbitrary.
Comments: [IS] For databases, the recommended field size for postal code seems to be a VARCHAR(16). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_code
Comments: [JH] I believe Ian's comment has been mis-interpreted, the guidance he suggested was for just the postcode part of the address. The point I was trying to get at (albeit awkwardly), was is there a best practice or some industry wide guide on addressing that could be used for the fit criterion?
