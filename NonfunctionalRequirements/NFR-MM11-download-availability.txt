Type: Performance
Rationale: The download feature should be available so customers can access the property details they need and to avoid reputational risk for the company due to broken features.
Fit Criterion: The download feature should not be unavailable for more than ~44 minutes per month on average to achieve the 99.9% uptime annually.
Originator: Ayashi Jayakodi

Comments: [SB-Sergejs Bolsedvorskis] The required uptime of 99.9% annually could result in very high costs for the infrastructure. The costs growth is non linear. The costs for the 95% uptime target could be marginally lower in contrast to the 99.9% uptime target. The download feature is important but it is not a business critical task. On the other hand, the website availability and payments processing are business critical processes and they will require higher uptime target. Even AWS sometimes struggles to achieve such uptime target. Good analysis on AWS outage in 2017 was published on Geek Wire. Brian Guy (2017) GeekWire [Online].
