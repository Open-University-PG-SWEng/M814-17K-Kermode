REQ-ID: MM11-NFR
Description: The download feature shall be available for a minimum of 99.9% uptime annually
Type: Performance
Rationale: The download feature should be available so customers can access the property details they need and to avoid reputational risk for the company due to broken features.
Fit Criterion: The download feature should not be unavailable for more than ~44 minutes per month on average to achieve the 99.9% uptime annually.
Originator: Ayashi Jayakodi

[SB-Sergejs Bolsedvorskis] The requirement of a minimum uptime of 99.9% annually could result in very high costs for the infrastructure. The costs growth is non linear, eg. the costs for the 95% uptime target could be marginally lower in contrast to the 99.9% uptime target. The download feature is important but it is not a business critical task. The website itself and payments processing are business critical components and they will require higher uptime target. Even AWS struggles to achieve such uptime targets. Good analysis on AWS outage in 2017 was published on Geek Wire. Brian Guy (2017) GeekWire [Online].

[PF-Paul Farmer] Shouldn't the description simply indicate that the product should maintain a high level of availability for the download feature. The fit criteria then specifies the actual level.
[PF] I also agree that the percentage specified creates a significant cost/benefit issue. The system may need to be unavailable for maintenance, backups etc., that could cause the target to be missed.
[PF] This requirement may force significant redundancy options to be considered that would cause the cost of implementation to escalate.
