[MM] The Fit Criterion is perhaps more of an ongoing business process than a quality the system can be assessed for. Perhaps the same could be said of the requirement. Outside of validation to check for the right types of information being entered I don't see how the system being developed can be checked for accuracy. If it were typed in that a property's address is in Brighton when it's actually in Blackpool, there's nothing the system being created can do to discern the quality of that data being entered. It's up to the agency to ensure that processes are in place to ensure accurate data is input. I don't think this would pass the gateway at the moment.
[CP] The Fit Criterion describes what the quality checking will be held against, but I think it should be more in the detail of how this is going to be checked. Could this be an automated process to validate the data entered in or would it trigger an alert for someone to manually validate it before it goes live?
[ESantos] Fir Criterion does not precise the number of times the properties need to be checked, this could could be avoided if the application could be able to update its data every month for instance.
