[MM] I don't feel this can pass the gateway at the moment as the Fit Criterion sounds more like a rationale to me. Provide a schedule so maintenance is carried out on time so customers don't complain is the intended benefit, not the measurable criteria that makes this passable. Perhaps something like 'The schedule of jobs satisfies all properties maintenance scheduling requirements with timeframes that do not clash, duplicate or take place when the property is occupied.'
[CP] The Fit Criterion does not validate what the description says, but instead it validates what is expected as a result. I would expect something requiring what the list should contain and details on when the jobs get posted. This is currently not somthing you could write a unit test for example.
[SS] The fit criterion appears to describe the outcomes of a successful business action, and feels to me to relate more to the quality of work carried out at each property rather than the system itself.
[ESantos] The Fit Criterion does not provide clear metrics in order to support the description, this is not helping the Non-Funcitonal Requirment at all.
