[KF] You have a contradiction between the description and the fit criterion - in the description it says no less than 5 images and the fit criterion states no more than 5 images.  I would consider raising the number of images, many of the competitor websites have an average of 15 photographs per property. You could also define the resolution as a higher resolution equals longer loading times.
[SW] What is High Definition? I think it should sepecifically state the resolutions or at least a minimum resolution. for example the minimum resolution could be 720p with a recommended resolution of 1080p. Also KF is correct in the contradiction between fit criteria and description.
[KB] I would agree with SW about mentioning a minimum resolution, this would make it less ambiguous when testing against the Fit criterion. You could also mention the number of colors such as 24-bit, 16 bit to define what colored means. If you are mentioning a time frame for the viewing of photos in the Fit criterion, you could probably add 'Performance' to the types of NFR.
