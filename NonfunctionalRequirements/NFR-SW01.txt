[IS] I can't help but think that this is the wrong point. Assuming that the sequence would be select property -> click to book -> fill out all details -> provide card payment, then shouldn't you have an effective "lock" at the point of clicking to book and release the "lock" either after completion or timeout? If someone is faster then you are in typing details you get to enter card details only to find the property has vanished under your feet.
